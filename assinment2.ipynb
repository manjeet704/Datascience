    " Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:Python supports two types of comments:\n",
    "Single-line comments: To create a single-line comment, use the hash symbol (#) followed by the comment text. Anything after the hash symbol on the same line is considered a comment and will be ignored by the interpreter.\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is another comment after a statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-line comments or block comments: Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments like some other programming languages. However, you can use triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") to create multi-line strings, which can act as multi-line comments. Since they are not assigned to any variable or used in any operation, they are essentially treated as comments.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "It spans multiple lines and is enclosed by triple quotes.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "print(\"This is not a comment.\")  # This is a single-line comment again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "Ans:variables are used to store and reference data values. A variable is like a container that holds a value,\n",
    "To create a variable, you simply choose a name for it and use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to it.\n",
    "Declaration and Assignment:\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "age = 24\n",
    "name = \"Manjeet kumar\"\n",
    "pi = 3.14\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "In Python, we can convert one data type to another using various type conversion functions or methods. The process of converting one data type to another is known as type casting or type conversion\n",
    "Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic Type Conversion):\n",
    "Python automatically performs certain type conversions when you combine different data types in expressions.\n",
    "x = 10        # integer\n",
    "y = 3.14      # float\n",
    "\n",
    "result = x + y  # Python automatically converts x to a float before the addition\n",
    "print(result)   # Output: 13.14\n",
    "Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting):\n",
    "You can explicitly convert one data type to another using specific built-in functions or methods. Here are some common examples:\n",
    "int(): Convert to integer data type.\n",
    "float(): Convert to floating-point data type.\n",
    "str(): Convert to string data type.\n",
    "list(): Convert to a list.\n",
    "tuple(): Convert to a tuple.\n",
    "set(): Convert to a set.\n",
    "dict(): Convert to a dictionary.\n",
    "num_str = \"42\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num_str)   # Convert string to integer\n",
    "num_float = float(num_str)   # Convert string to float\n",
    "Using str.format() or f-strings:\n",
    "You can convert other data types to strings using string formatting.\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "name = \"Manjeet kumar\"\n",
    "\n",
    "age_str = str(age)   # Convert integer to string\n",
    "message = \"My name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age)   # Using str.format()\n",
    "message_f = f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"   # Using f-strings \n",
    "Remember that not all types can be converted to each other directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "Ans:To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:\n",
    "Step 1: Create a Python script\n",
    "Open a text editor (such as Notepad, VSCode, or Sublime Text) and write your Python code in it. Save the file with a .py extension, which indicates that it is a Python script. For example, you can create a file named myscript.py with the following content:\n",
    "# myscript.py\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "Step 2: Open the Command Line Interface (CLI)\n",
    "On Windows, open the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell. On macOS and Linux, open the Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Navigate to the script's directory\n",
    "Use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is in the Documents folder, you can use:\n",
    "# Windows\n",
    "cd C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "# macOS / Linux\n",
    "cd ~/Documents\n",
    "Step 4: Execute the Python script\n",
    "To run the Python script, you need to use the python command followed by the name of your script file.\n",
    "python myscript.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Given a list my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list [2, 3].\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using list slicing to get the sub-list [2, 3]\n",
    "sub_list = my_list[1:3]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sub_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?\n",
    "Ans:In mathematics, a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit defined as the square root of -1. The real part (a) represents the ordinary real number, and the imaginary part (bi) represents the imaginary component of the complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the complex number a + bi:\n",
    "\n",
    "a is the real part.\n",
    "b is the imaginary part.\n",
    "i is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "In Python, you can represent complex numbers using the complex() built-in function or by directly writing them in the form a + bj, where j is used instead of i to represent the imaginary unit.\n",
    "# Using complex() function\n",
    "z1 = complex(2, 3)   # Represents 2 + 3i\n",
    "z2 = complex(-1, 4)  # Represents -1 + 4i\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using 'j' to represent the imaginary unit\n",
    "z3 = 6 + 2j         # Represents 6 + 2i\n",
    "z4 = -3j            # Represents 0 - 3i (real part is 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(z1)  # Output: (2+3j)\n",
    "print(z2)  # Output: (-1+4j)\n",
    "print(z3)  # Output: (6+2j)\n",
    "print(z4)  # Output: (-3j)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the correct way to declare a variable named age and assign the value 25 to it?\n",
    "Ans:The correct way to declare a variable named age and assign the value 25 to it in Python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Declare a variable named price and assign the value 9.99 to it. What data type does this variable\n",
    "belong to?\n",
    "Ans:To declare a variable named price and assign the value 9.99 to it\n",
    "price = 9.99\n",
    "The data type of the variable price is a floating-point number (float). In Python, any number with a decimal point is considered a float data type. Floats are used to represent real numbers and can have both integer and fractional parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify the data type of the variable price using the type() function:\n",
    "price = 9.99\n",
    "print(type(price))\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Create a variable named name and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the\n",
    "value of this variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "name = \"Manjeet Kumar Verma\"\n",
    "print(name)\n",
    "To print the value of the name variable, you can use the print() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Given the string \"Hello, World!\", extract the substring \"World\".\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "my_str= \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "substr = my_str[7:12]\n",
    "print(substr)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Create a variable named \"is_student\" and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are\n",
    "currently a student or not.\n",
